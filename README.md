# Arduino-T002-Laser-Tank-Base64

### Laser Tank Base64 Tutorial
This tutorial 2 for my 5.5w Laser Tank (LT).  It teaches you how to incorporate Base64 and gzip compression to reduce the size of your Arduino code base.  You create a custom webpage, gzip it, encode it with Base64 and save it to your Arduino.  After a connection is made your Arduino server will decode it then transmit it to the client.  The client can then interact with the Arduino hardware using an integrated websocket server.

> #### WebPage Features
> - Multiple Buttons to control speed and direction of the LT
> - Ability to change the LT's configuration
> - Ability to control the Secondary Processor
> - Provide Status and System Feedback
